Project Overview
Your task is to develop a simple web application with an API and data layer using .NET C#,
ASP.NET MVC, Web API, and a database or data store, while adhering to Clean Architecture
principles and using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies.
Your development should be driven by an informal user story that you will create, and which
should be included in your presentation.
The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete records from the data via
the API endpoints. Additionally, you should create a user, login as the user, and ensure that the
user information is stored in the data.
To showcase your ability to work with modern data storage systems you cannot use Entity
Framework, Dapper, or Mediator to complete this assignment.
Requirements
Backend
● Database:
○ Create a database or other data storage solution with at least one
table/object/container to store data for the application and an additional one to
store users.
○ The table/object/container should have a unique identifier (primary key) and at
least two other fields.
● API:
○ Develop an ASP.NET Web API with endpoints that allow users to perform CRUD
operations on the data.
○ Each endpoint should have appropriate HTTP verbs, parameters, and return
values.
○ Additionally, a second API should include endpoints for user creation, user login,
and authorized and non-authorized endpoints.
● Data layer:
○ Develop a data access layer that interacts with the data and provides the
necessary CRUD operations for the API endpoints.
● Business logic layer:
○ Develop a business logic layer that includes all of the business rules and
validation for the application.
○ This layer should be independent of the data layer and the API.
● Unit tests:
○ Write unit tests for all components of the application, including the data access
layer, business logic layer, and API endpoints.

Frontend
● While the main focus is on .NET, we need a decent level of full stack development
skills, so:
○ Please integrate the backend you just built with a frontend framework of your
choice (React, Vue, etc.).
○ Key criteria:
■ The frontend should be responsive and user-friendly.
■ Implement CRUD operations associated with the implemented use case.
■ Structured code: Organize your components and state cleanly.
● Submission Guidelines:
○ Include a README with setup instructions and any other documentation you
deem necessary.
○ The application should have seeded data / credentials for demo purposes.
Generative AI tools
Imagine you’re tasked with generating a RESTful API for a simple task management system
using your preferred language. The system should support the following functionality:
● Create, read, update, and delete tasks (CRUD)
● Each task has a title, description, status, and due_date
● Tasks are associated with a user (assume basic User model exists)
Instructions:
● Using your preferred GenAI coding tool (e.g., Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, GitHub
Copilot, etc.), write the prompt you would use to generate the API scaffold or full
implementation.
● Show the output code (or a representative sample of it).
● Describe how you:
● Validated the AI's suggestions
● Corrected or improved the output, if necessary
● Handled edge cases, authentication, or validations

Additional criteria:
● Clean Architecture: Your architecture should adhere to Clean Architecture principles,
including separation of concerns and independence of components.
● Application testing: Your project should have sufficient test coverage. Use of TDD is
preferable.
● Code quality: Your code should be well-organized, readable, and adhere to best
practices.
● Functionality: Your application should perform as expected in the requirements without
errors or bugs. Optional but desired: no warnings in the browser console.
● Presentation: Your presentation should be clear, concise, and demonstrate a good
understanding of the project and of the main backend and frontend best practices.
● GenAI tools: Your answers and presentation must show fluency with GenAI tools and
prompt engineering, and critical thinking when evaluating AI-generated code.
